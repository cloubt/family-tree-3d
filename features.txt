    add texture to vertices?

animate neighborhood selection (this would take a LOT of work)

relation selector (when edge clicked make all others transparent)

general ui to do everything (change colors, randomize position, etc)

custom family tree maker??????????????? like you can spawn in your own vertices/edges?????
