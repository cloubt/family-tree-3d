make vertices moveable (use coordinate thing from spline example)
    add texture to vertices?

animate neighborhood selection (this would take a LOT of work)
    -maybe not if you figure out how to use tween
    
relation selector (when edge clicked make all others transparent)

general ui to do everything (change colors, randomize position, etc)
    -specific node selection: when clicked, gui populates with selected node and you can edit it
    -relations tab where you can enable/disable certain edges from showing up (e.g. only show married and friends, only siblings, etc)

custom family tree maker??????????????? like you can spawn in your own vertices/edges?????

use Meshline plugin??? (https://github.com/spite/THREE.MeshLine) or convert them to mesh??



COMPLETED
------------------------
make it so that vertices never spawn too close to each other (adjust bouding boxes during spawn and check for collisions?)

convert data to json with node.js fs module
    do this already...
    import into main
    graph function to handle json data
    spawn in everything from said json data

converted lines to cylinders
spaced directed lines out

profiling capabilities

make lines better

neighborhood selector (when vertex clicked, make all others transparent)
